// (a) Single most-recent-year (2025) snapshot — Ownwell's county-level

//     (https://www.ownwell.com/results/texas-protest-vs-non-protest and
//     per-county pages, e.g. ownwell.com/insight/*-property-tax-protest-results-*).
// (b) Three-year (2022-2024) blended average — Ownwell's separate three-year
//     study (https://www.ownwell.com/insight/three-year-impact-protesting-property-taxes-texas),
//     "average reduction in property valuation when won" per county.
//
// Averaging (a) and (b) makes the figure less sensitive to any single unusual
// year without inventing a year-by-year breakdown that was never published.
// Only available for counties where BOTH real, county-specific figures were
// found (Bexar, Collin, Fort Bend, Harris, Travis); Denton and Tarrant use
// only their real single-source figure, since the other half of the pair
// isn't a genuine county-specific number for them (see below) — never
// blending a real county figure with a multi-county regional number just to
// have two data points.
//
// Commercial: O'Connor's real 2025 per-CAD appeal-result analyses (each
// county has its own published article, e.g.

// commercial number was published. No multi-year commercial study was found
