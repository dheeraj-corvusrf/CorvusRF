// Every county below used to be gated behind a city-name regex (e.g. only try

// reliably indicates a county. It doesn't: three separate real-address bug reports
// on 2026-07-24 each turned out to be this same assumption failing a different way
// — Frisco/Prosper/Celina/Little Elm/The Colony are real parcels in *either*
// Collin or Denton depending on the specific address, and USPS assigns "Dallas" as
// the mailing city for large swaths of ZIP codes that are legally in Collin or
// Denton County, not Dallas County. Enumerating every small town and unincorporated
// area in ten counties (plus every USPS mailing-city quirk) is an unbounded,
// unwinnable list. So this now just queries every supported county in parallel for
// every address and takes the first one that returns a real record, in the fixed
// priority order below — no city-name filtering at all. The per-county ArcGIS/GIS
// queries are cheap, public, and independent, so this costs a few concurrent HTTP
// calls (bounded by the slowest single county, not the sum) rather than any real
// correctness risk, and permanently closes off this entire class of bug.

// Every single-field county query below builds its LIKE pattern as
// `${house} %${coreStreetName(street)}%` — house number anchored to the very START
// of the field (NO leading `%`), followed by a required literal space, THEN a
// wildcard before the core street name. Two bugs, found in sequence on 2026-07-26:
//
// 1) The original pattern was `%${house} ${core}%` (leading wildcard, house+core
//    exactly one space apart). Denton's situs field stores "3500 N BONNIE BRAE ST"
//    — the directional sits BETWEEN the house number and the core name — so
//    house+core being forced adjacent-with-one-space silently failed on any
//    address whose county data embeds a directional right after the house number.
// 2) The first fix for that — `%${house}%${core}%`, a wildcard in place of the
//    space — went too far: with a LEADING wildcard too, "%2021%" matches the
//    DIGITS "2021" occurring ANYWHERE in the field, including as a prefix of an
//    unrelated house number like "20217" or a suffix like "1103" (which contains
//    "103"). Sampling ~100 real addresses across all 11 counties on 2026-07-26
//    turned up over a dozen cases of this returning a completely different real
//    property — sometimes in a different county entirely — as a false positive
//    "match" (e.g. "103 Berkshire St, Bellaire" incorrectly resolved to a Denton
//    County record at "1103 Berkshire Ct, Trophy Club"). Silently wrong data is
//    worse than "not found," so this needed a real fix, not another loosening.
//
// The current pattern fixes both: no leading `%` anchors the house number to the
// true start of the field (so "103" can never match inside "1103"), and the
// required literal space right after it anchors the house number's own end (so
// "2021" can't match as a prefix of "20217"). The wildcard AFTER that space is what
// still tolerates a directional or anything else sitting between the house number
// and the core street name.

// Highway-named streets are stored under wildly different conventions per county —
// found 2026-07-26 chasing a real address ("5800 North Interstate 35, Denton"):
// Denton stores it as "I35" (no space, no word at all), Travis stores US highways
// as "U S HY 183" (literally spaced out), Montgomery spells interstates out in
// full ("INTERSTATE 45"), and Bexar abbreviates to "IH 10" — four different real
// conventions for the same concept, confirmed across four counties. No single
// rewrite of the user's input can match all of them, so this generates every
// plausible variant instead and tries them all (OR'd) in the same query.
//
// FM (Farm-to-Market) roads are the exact same problem, found 2026-09-02 chasing
// a real report: "FM1957, San Antonio, TX 78245" (typed with no space, no house
// number — a real highway-frontage commercial property with no numbered address
// at all) returned nothing. Confirmed live against Bexar's own data: searching
// the literal typed "FM1957" matches zero rows, but "FM 1957" (with a space) is
// exactly how Bexar stores it — e.g. "11440 FM 1957 SAN ANTONIO, TX 78245", a
// real match for this exact report. RM (Ranch-to-Market) and RR (Ranch Road) are
// the same style of Texas road prefix, included here on the same pattern.
//
// A second, separate form of the same problem, found 2026-09-02 chasing the
// SAME report after the fix above shipped and the user still couldn't search
// it: picking "FM1957, San Antonio, TX 78245" from the address autocomplete
// dropdown (the realistic flow — not typing the abbreviated form and hitting
// Validate directly) hands this app Google's own spelled-out street name —
// confirmed live via Place Details: "FM1957" resolves to addressComponents
// longText "Farm to Market Road 1957", and "RM2222"/"RR620" alike both
// resolve to "Ranch to Market Road 2222"/"620" (Google doesn't distinguish
// RM from RR by name at all). AddressAutocomplete.tsx deliberately prefers
// this un-abbreviated longText over the abbreviated form for a different,
// already-fixed bug (see buildAddressFromComponents's own comment — mid-word
// abbreviations like "Market Pl" broke matching for "Market Place Blvd"), so
// the fix belongs here, recognizing Google's spelled-out form as a variant
// input rather than fighting that same abbreviation problem again.
//
// The same two-sided problem (abbreviated typed form vs. Google's spelled-out
// form) applies to every other Texas highway-style road prefix this app
// already space-normalizes client-side (see TX_ROAD_PREFIX in
// AddressAutocomplete.tsx: FM/RM/CR/SH/US/IH/LP/LOOP/SPUR) but this function
// didn't yet recognize. Extended 2026-09-02, each confirmed live the same way
// as FM above — a real county record AND Google's real Place Details output
// for a real road of that type. Kept deliberately minimal per variant (only
// forms actually confirmed live, not every plausible spelling) after finding
// that Loop 1604 — a genuinely huge, high-traffic road with thousands of real
// records — pushed Tarrant's and Harris's already-known-slow wildcard scans
// (see NEARBY_QUERY_TIMEOUT_MS's own history above) well past even the
// bumped 10s timeout with the first, more generous variant list tried; a
// leading-wildcard LIKE scan's cost scales with the number of OR'd variants
// on these two backends specifically, so fewer-but-confirmed variants is both
// more honest AND faster:
// - Loop: Bexar stores "5040 E LOOP 1604 ELMENDORF" and Denton stores
//   "1703 S LOOP 288, DENTON" — both spell "LOOP" out already (never
//   abbreviated "LP" in any real record found, so no "LP" variants are
//   generated despite TX_ROAD_PREFIX assuming the abbreviation exists
//   somewhere — not confirmed, not guessed here). Google's own longText for
//   a specific frontage-road segment can come back directional-QUALIFIED on
//   both ends ("West Loop 1604 South" — confirmed live), not just prefixed —
//   the trailing directional is tolerated below (matched, not captured) so it
//   doesn't break the end-anchored match.
// - State highways: Bexar has BOTH "S STATE HWY 16 VON ORMY" and
//   "23167 SH 16 S VON ORMY" for the literal same road — two real, different
//   stored forms in the very same county. Google's own longText resolves
//   "SH16" to "Texas Highway 16" — a third real, confirmed form; all three
//   are generated. "State Highway" and "TX Highway" were dropped — neither
//   showed up in the real county data or Google's real output, only "guessed
//   by analogy," which is exactly what this fix exists to avoid doing.
// - County roads: Bexar stores "216 COUNTY ROAD 125 ELMENDORF" spelled out —
//   no abbreviated "CR 125" form found in any real record — and Google's own
//   longText for "CR125" independently resolves to "County Road 125", the
//   same spelled-out form. The abbreviated "CR"/"CR-" variants are still
//   generated for a directly-typed abbreviated address, which has no
//   autocomplete resolution step to expand it.
// Spur was NOT extended here — TX_ROAD_PREFIX assumes it exists, but no real
// NUMBERED Spur route turned up in Bexar's or Denton's own data while
// checking the above (only literal street NAMES containing the word "Spur",
// a false-positive shape, not a highway prefix) — left alone rather than
// guessed, per this file's own standing discipline (see the Sixth bug class

// --- Enrichment (Phase 5, 2026-07-27) ---------------------------------------
// Best-effort second call, made ONLY after a county's own primary query above has
// already matched a record by address. Never used to find or select a property —
// only to attach extra detail (legal description, deed history, value history,
// mailing address, protest status) that the ArcGIS parcel layers don't carry, by
// looking up the SAME property on that county's own richer public website via its
// vendor's JSON API. Enrichment failures (network error, vendor API shape change,
// no match) are swallowed and simply leave the extra fields absent — a lookup
// must never fail, and a confirm screen must never show stale/wrong enrichment,
// just because a second, non-essential vendor call didn't work this time.
//
// Four real second sources now cover 8 of the 11 counties (see
// texas_cad_vendor_landscape memory for the remaining 3 — Collin/Harris are
// bot-walled, Bexar's own second source is now also infrastructure-blocked):
//   - TrueProdigy (Denton, Montgomery, Tarrant, Travis): confirmed live 2026-07-27
//     that each county's own ArcGIS accountNumber IS that county's TrueProdigy
//     "pid" (Tarrant's needs its leading zeros stripped first).
//   - BIS Consultants (Fort Bend, Grayson): Fort Bend's ArcGIS accountNumber
//     (PROPNUMBER) matches BIS's own "geoId" field; Grayson's ArcGIS accountNumber
//     (PropertyNumber) matches BIS's own "propertyId" field instead — different
//     cross-reference key per county, both confirmed live.
//   - Williamson (Phase 6, 2026-08-11): search.wcad.org's own unauthenticated JSON
//     search API — see enrichWilliamson below.
//   - Dallas (Phase 6, 2026-08-11): dallascad.org's plain-GET account-detail pages,
//     keyed directly by the already-trusted account number — see enrichDallas
//     below, including why it doesn't need the same house-number cross-check.
//
// TrueProdigy/BIS/Williamson enrichment is keyed off the property ID or address
// already trusted from the primary match — never re-derived from the user's typed
// address — and is cross-checked against the primary match's own house number
// before merging, so a wrong cross-county ID coincidence can never silently attach
// one property's deed/value history onto a different property's screen.
