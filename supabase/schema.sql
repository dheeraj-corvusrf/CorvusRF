-- from decision_notices above, which records an ALREADY-final outcome) —
-- upload, AI-verified read of the settled value/terms against the case's
-- own real facts, explicit user confirmation, then a real signature. The
-- original upload is document_id; once signed, signed_document_id points
-- at the certified copy (see settlement-agreement.ts's appendSignaturePage)
-- the user actually downloads and submits — this app has no e-filing
-- integration with any county, so submission itself always stays on the
-- user. Same signature_type/signature_data shape as
-- protest_form_submissions, but a separate table: that one is scoped to
-- this app's OWN generated forms (field_values matches a known schema),
-- while this is an arbitrary document the county produced.
